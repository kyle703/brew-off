# üç∫ Oktoberfest Brew-Off Results Portal

This project hosts a **static site** to display the results of the Brew-Off competition in a fun, party-friendly way.  
It pulls data from two public Google Sheets and one Google Drive folder:

- **Registrants Sheet (TSV)**: Beer entries with brewer, name, style, ABV, and label assets
- **Judging Sheet (TSV)**: Judges‚Äô scores and results
- **Beer Label Assets (Drive folder)**: Public folder of uploaded images, used in carousel + winner reveal
